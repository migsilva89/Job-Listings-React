# Job listings with filtering and modal - React - TailwindCss

This is a solution to the [Job listings with filtering challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/job-listings-with-filtering-ivstIPCt).

### The challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size;
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page;
- Filter job listings based on the categories;
- I have also added a modal that will be activated when a job name is clicked;
